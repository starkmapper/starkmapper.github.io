# Developer Behavior: Sprint Planning

![](images/Developer%20Behavior%20-%20Daily%20Scrum6.jpg)

How can Developers 💪help💪 or 💥hurt💥 Sprint Planning?

The goal of the Sprint Planning is to create a common understanding of what can be accomplished during the Sprint.
I like to think of as answering:

* 1️⃣ **Why** should our stakeholders want to pay💸 for this sprint?
* 2️⃣ **What** can we deliver🎁 to our customers to achieve this?
* 3️⃣ **How** will we organize ourselves to get it Done✅?

Developers play a crucial role in answering these three questions. As such, their behavior will make or break this event, and the Sprint itself.😱

**Hurts**:

* 💥 **Detailing** out as much work as possible
* 💥 **Assigning work** to individual team members
* 💥 **Using a "Definition of Ready"** as an excuse not to start

**Helps**:

* 💪 **Negotiating goal and scope** with an emphasis on what is possible
* 💪 **Work on broad-stroking a design** with the team, stakeholders and experts
* 💪 **Bring potential complications to the table**, like new tech, external dependencies or (known) issues
