# Developer Behavior: Sprint Review

![](images/Developer%20Behavior%20-%20Sprint%20Review%20Code.jpg)

**Developers: Are you secretly sabotaging your own Sprint Review?**

How can you ðŸ’ªhelpðŸ’ª or ðŸ’¥hurtðŸ’¥ the Sprint Review?

The goal of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. I like to think of it as the Scrum Team and stakeholders discussing why their work is valuable, and how to keep it that way!

**Hurts**:

ðŸ’¥ Presenting work, WIP or even code. Focus on finding out what's important to the stakeholders instead.
ðŸ’¥ Disrespect other Team members or Stakeholders by saying things like: "That'll never work", "You're wrong" or "You don't understand". Ask clarifying questions instead. Be the expert!
ðŸ’¥ Shirking Ownership: blame others for issues, leave the review to the Product Owner, ignoring stakeholder altogether. Focus on what you can do, and ask for support instead.

**Helps**:

ðŸ’ª Have working product, so your stakeholders can experience what has been achieved, then gather feedback and look forward together.
ðŸ’ª Show up prepared as a Team, get involved in the discussion to build a common understanding of what is desired as well as possible.  
ðŸ’ª Ask for help! The perfect opportunity to if you can connect your challenges with customer outcomes!
