# Developer Behavior: Sprint

![](images/Developer%20Behavior%20-%20Sprint%202.jpg)

**Are you showing up as a limited Developer each sprint?**

Sprints are more than just pushing codeâ€”they're **micro-innovation "projects"**: build and deliver something valuable, gather data, inspect and adapt. If you do it right, your stakeholders won't get enough!

But how can you as a Developer ðŸ’ªhelpðŸ’ª or ðŸ’¥hurtðŸ’¥ the Sprint?

**Hurt:**  
* ðŸ’¥ **Be limited**: Architects are for Architecture, Testers are for testing, and you are for writing code? No way! Own **all** the work. If you're a code typist, AI will gladly take your job!    
* ðŸ’¥ **Be waiting**: Waiting for someone to tell you what to do? Waiting to raise an issue? Thatâ€™s wasting time. Youâ€™re part of an expert teamâ€”solve problems *together*.   
* ðŸ’¥ **Be scared**: Playing it safe? Afraid to try something new or adjust the plan? How are you going to learn if you never take a risk?   

**Help:**   
* ðŸ’ª **Be focused**: Always know why your work is valuable. Align everything you do with thatâ€”every. single. day.   
* ðŸ’ª **Be learning**: Critical, Constructive and Pragmatic (CCP). Hold yourself and others accountable to doing better together.   
* ðŸ’ª **Be replaceable**: From tracking progress to sharing knowledge, set your team up to continue without you. If the team succeeds, you succeed.

Now you're ready to break the limit!
