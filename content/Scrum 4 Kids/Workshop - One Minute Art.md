# DRAFT Scrum 4 Kids Workshop: One Minute Art

Workshop that will allow participants of all levels to experience Scrum by drawing with a large group.

## Details

* Goal: Teach foundational Scrum at scale
* Duration: 20-50 minutes
* Number of Participants: 8-50
* Space arrangement: small groups of 4-6 people (preferably with chairs and tables, but anything that will allow participants to draw on stickies will work)
* Materials needed:
  * (Colored) Stickies - to draw on
  * (Colored) Markers - to draw with
  * Multiple sheets of large paper (Brown paper, flip over etc.) - to collect everyone's work every round
  * Masking tape - to stick the large paper to the wall

## Steps

### Preparation

1. Hang a large paper on the wall
2. Optional: Distribute drawing materials

!!! Note

    If you have multi-color drawing materials, you can enhance the learning experience by creating scarcity of colors.
    Placing all materials in a central place will enable participants to pratice intra-group communication.
    Placing one color on each table will enable participants to practice inter-group communication.

### Round 1: Challenge - Making a beautiful drawing

In this round participants are invited to experience a common challenge together: working together effectively in large groups.

1. Have participants form small groups.
1. Explain that we will be creating a beautiful drawing together on the one large piece of paper. Make sure you're extra vague on the intended result, and how we expect to get there.
1. Invite participants to each take a marker and contribute to the drawing. Some participants may need some encouragement, and some may skip in this round. That is to be expected and perfectly OK. Try to encourage participants to contribute, but accept their trepidation.
1. After about 1 minute, instruct participants to stop drawing, and return to their groups. It's important that participants have enough time to experience the challenge, but not nearly enough to actually contribute. You'll know it's time to stop when participants are getting a bit frustrated.
1. Debrief: Lightheartedly ask participants if they think the end-result is "beautiful". Next ask what the experience was like for them and what behavior they observed.

!!! Note

    Use a Liberating Structure like [1-2-4-all] if you have a very diverse audience.

### Round 2: Concept - Goal, Rules and Steps

In this round we'll introduce the concepts of common goals, minimal rules, and progressing towards your goals in small steps.

![We leverage the results of round 1 to drive home the need for improvement](images/Round%202%20-%20concept.jpg)

1. Put up a new piece of large paper. We'll be using this one paper for the rest of the workshop.
1. After inspecting the result of Round 1, it's time to introduce three requirements of working together:

   1. A Common Goal - What is it we're all trying to achieve together, how will we know we've reached it? Use examples of outcome driven goals rather than output driver goals (i.e. "Make a drawing to remember a beautiful sunset on the beach" rather than "Draw the beach, the sea, and the sun setting above it.")
   1. A Minimal set of rules - What rules do we NEED to be able to progress towards that goal.
   1. A single step toward that goal - the smallest possible step we could take in achieving the common goal. Challenge participants to come up with outcome driver intermediate goals. (i.e. "A beach that reminds me of a bounty island" rather than "white sandy beach with palm trees").
1. Defining the common goal for the workshop:
   1. Find a person to be the beneficiary (teacher, manager, sponsor etc.). Make it clear to everyone that during this workshop, the beneficiary is an external customer commissioning work from their own money.
   1. Interview your beneficiary about what they think is beautiful.
   1. Have the participants ask clarifying questions. Limit this to 3-5 questions.
   1. Write down some keywords on stickies or on the poster.
1. Creating a minimal set of rules
   1. Set one rule: Only the large paper will de judged by the beneficiary, and the beneficiary only. (See note below)
   1. Ask participants to come up with 3 simple rules that will help them create a drawing with their group. Collect one per group. The minimal outcome should be to draw on stickies, and put them on the canvas when done. Depending on the level of the group you can ask some leading questions like:
      * What can we do to involve everyone given the limited canvas size?
      * How will we decide on things like what color stickies to use?
      * When and how will we place stickies on the large paper?
      * If we were to agree on one thing, what would it be?
1. Crafting the first step together: Ask the beneficiary to describe what they might like to see after another 1 minute of drawing. (Intermediate Goal)

### Round 3: Exercise - Reaching your goal, finding out how along the way

In this round participants are invited to identify a step towards their common goal, and attempt to reach it within 1 minute.
Then we'll reflect on progress towards our common goal, and the way we're operating to achieve it.
This round can be repeated as many times as you have time for.
The goal here is to practice:

1. Setting (intermediate) goals
1. Working together in a timebox
1. Reflecting on progress towards goals and adapting subsequent goals and work agreements iteratively
1. Bonus(?): Removing goals and/or agreements when they don't work out

![Creating rules and crafting goals together](images/Round%203%20-%20Instruction.jpg)

1. Ask every group to contribute to the goal as best they can within the time limit of 1 minute.
1. 

### Round 4: Connect - How do you make a beautiful drawing?

In this round we'll guide participants through connecting their takeaways to the original challenge: working together effectively. With a focus on making them actionable.
