# Unleashing the Developer Stances onto the world 👇Trading Cards below👇

Last week, I released my beloved Developer Stances into the wild by means of playing cards and improv!
During my session, 50+ agile professionals got to experience 45 minutes in the life of a Developer.🧑‍💻
I invited them to pick a card, any card, and (literally) take their first steps as one of the Developer Stances.👟👠👡👢
Building up their skill and moxy step by step, I had them doing full-fledged improv at the end of the session.🤯
Talking about unleashing potential, you should all be very proud of the 10-minute play you put on for the group! 🌋(Retrospective on a volcano)🎭

Thank you all so much for participating, and all the amazing feedback on the stances, the playing cards, and the session.🫶

The Trading Cards, Facilitation plan "Lite" and future developments can be found in the comments.

Leave some feedback while you're in there!🙏
