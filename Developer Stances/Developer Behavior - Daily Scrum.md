# Developer Behavior: Daily Scrum

![](images/Developer%20Behavior%20-%20Daily%20Scrum5.jpg)

**How can Developers ðŸ’ªhelpðŸ’ª or ðŸ’¥hurtðŸ’¥ the Daily Scrum?**

The goal of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

I like to think of it as the Developers agreeing on how to work towards the Sprint Goal for the next 24 hours.

**Hurts**:

ðŸ’¥ **Play bad Project Manager**, taking progress reports, assigning work and talking in ticket numbers.
ðŸ’¥ **Holding work hostage**, being vague about progress, covering up potential issues and removing the possibility for the team to help.
ðŸ’¥ **Waste time** by showing up late and unprepared or going super in-depth

**Helps**:

ðŸ’ª **Run It!** Create a plan on how to work together to remove impediments, limit WIP and get things to Done.
ðŸ’ª **Focus on the Sprint Goal**, and make sure the Product Owner is available
ðŸ’ª **Offer help,** always. If someone has to ask, you failed them as a team.
