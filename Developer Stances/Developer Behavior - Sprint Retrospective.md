# Developer Behavior: Sprint Retrospective

![](images/Developer%20Behavior%20-%20Sprint%20Retrospective.jpg)

**Leaving the Retrospective to your Scrum Master? You're missing out!**

The goal of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. I like to think of it as the Scrum Team discovering what behaviors in and around the team will help them, and how to cultivate these to increase team effectiveness.

How can you as a Developer 💪help💪 or 💥hurt💥 the Sprint Retrospective?

𝗛𝘂𝗿𝘁:
💥 **Be in denial:** Only sharing success? Staying vague? Talking code? That’s a miss. Focus on actionable process improvements you can start right now.
💥 **Be negative:** Constantly moaning about things out of your control? Skip the complaints and find solutions. If you can’t fix it - move on.
💥 Be hostile: Attacking others in the room? Come on. That’s not how pros operate. Support each other and find solutions together.

𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗽:
💪 **Be accountable:** Show up prepared, own your part, and hold each other accountable like professionals.
💪 **Be personal:** We’re all human, we all screw up. Say "please", "thank you" or "sorry" when it counts.
💪 **Be open:** Accept feedback - good or bad - PERIOD! Growth happens from both success stories and tough situations.

Want to crush the next retro? Stop leaving it to someone else. Own it.
Heck, you might even have fun! 😎

What behavior do you see hurting retrospectives?
